# Country Data (PHP)

A comprehensive PHP array containing a list of countries with their names, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes, international dial codes, and flag emojis.

## Features

* Includes a wide range of countries.
* Data is structured as an associative array for easy access.
* Sorted alphabetically by country name.
* Provides essential information for web development tasks like dropdown menus, phone number validation, and displaying country-specific information.

## Usage

### 1. Installation (via Composer - Recommended)

If you're using Composer in your PHP project, you can add this repository as a dependency.

```bash
composer require VihangaNethmaka/PHP-Country-List
````

Then, you can include the data in your PHP code:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// If the file is in the data directory
$countries = require 'vendor/vihanganethmaka/php-country-list/data/countries.php';

// Now you can work with the $countries array
print_r($countries[0]); // Output: Array ( [name] => Afghanistan [code] => AF [dial_code] => +93 [flag] => ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡« )

?>
```

### 2\. Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can directly download the `countries.php` file and include it in your project:

```php
<?php

require 'path/to/your/downloaded/PHP-Country-List/data/countries.php';

// Now you can work with the $countries array
print_r($countries[1]); // Output: Array ( [name] => Albania [code] => AL [dial_code] => +355 [flag] => ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡± )

?>
```

## Data Structure

The `$countries` array is an indexed array of associative arrays. Each inner array represents a country and has the following keys:

  * `name`: The common name of the country (string).
  * `code`: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (string).
